# Kill Zscaler for macOS

A simple utility to control Zscaler VPN service on macOS. This tool provides easy ways to stop and start Zscaler when needed.

## Features

- Simple GUI application to stop/start Zscaler
- Shell scripts for command-line control
- VPN tunnel sharing capability
- Support for shell aliases

## Using the App

The easiest way to use this tool is through the GUI applications:

1. Download and extract this repository
2. Use `Kill Zscaler.app` to stop Zscaler
3. Use `Start Zscaler.app` to restart Zscaler

## Command Line Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nicholasg-dev/kill-zscaler.git
   cd kill-zscaler
   ```

2. Make the scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x kill-zscaler.sh start-zscaler.sh
   ```

3. Run the scripts:
   ```bash
   ./kill-zscaler.sh  # To stop Zscaler
   ./start-zscaler.sh # To start Zscaler
   ```

## Shell Aliases

For quick access, you can set up shell aliases:

1. Open your shell's configuration file:
   - For Bash: `~/.bashrc`
   - For ZSH: `~/.zshrc`

2. Add these aliases:
   ```bash
   # Start Zscaler
   alias start-zscaler="open -a /Applications/Zscaler/Zscaler.app --hide; sudo find /Library/LaunchDaemons -name '*zscaler*' -exec launchctl load {} \;"
   
   # Stop Zscaler
   alias kill-zscaler="find /Library/LaunchAgents -name '*zscaler*' -exec launchctl unload {} \;;sudo find /Library/LaunchDaemons -name '*zscaler*' -exec launchctl unload {} \;"
   ```

3. Reload your shell configuration:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # For Bash
   source ~/.zshrc   # For ZSH
   ```
## VPN Tunnel Sharing

You can share your Zscaler VPN tunnel with other devices using the `share-zscaler.v2.sh` script:

```bash
./share-zscaler.v2.sh --probe foo.bar.internal --domain internal
```

This will:
1. Set up NAT (Network Address Translation) on your VPN client
2. Configure DNS resolution for specified domains
3. Generate configuration instructions for other devices

Parameters:
- `--probe`: Hostname to test VPN connectivity
- `--domain`: Domain(s) to route through the VPN
      Display.Height=1080
      Display.DPI=96
      Sound.Enabled=0
      Network.Type=1
      CONFIG
      open "$VMDIR"
      open -a "$PARALLELS" "$VMDIR/$NAME.macvm"
      ```
      Take the chance to customize the above settings to your requirements.   
      **At the time of writing, the disk size cannot be altered later.**  
      40GB disk space (see `--disksize` argument) are recommended.  
      32GB disk space are the bare minimum.  
   3. Create a macOS user
   4. Install Parallels Tools and reboot
   5. Install Zscaler
   6. Login
3. Establish connection
   1. Start Zscaler (if not already running)
   2. [Run share-zscaler.sh](#sharing-zscaler)
4. Use connection
   1. On your local machine open a terminal
   2. Paste the host configuration script (that was printed in the previous step) in the terminal and run it

**You can now connect to all hosts you listed in step 2** ðŸŽ‰

Optionally, you can set the name of your VM in
1. System Preferences â†’ Network â†’ Ethernet â†’ Advanced... â†’ WINS â†’ NetBIOS Name
2. System Preferences â†’ Sharing â†’ Computer Name

## Remote Execution

This section describes the necessary steps to run `share-zscaler.v2.sh` on your
local machine instead of the virtual Zscaler machine using SSH.

### Preparation

#### On your virtual machine
1. Activate SSH by checking System Preferences â†’ Sharing â†’ Remote Login
2. Optionally extend your sudoers so that you may run `sysctl` and `pfctl` without having to enter your password:
   ```shell
   (
   echo "$(whoami) ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/sysctl *"
   echo "$(whoami) ALL=NOPASSWD: /sbin/pfctl *"
   ) | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/zscaler
   ```
3. Optionally prepare a script with the following contents to lock your screen
   ```bash
   cat << 'LOCK_SCREEN' > ~/Desktop/lock-screen
   #!/bin/bash
   osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to keystroke "q" using {command down,control down}'
   LOCK_SCREEN
   chmod +x ~/Desktop/lock-screen
   ```
   and run it on login via System Preferences â†’ *Choose your user* â†’ Login items â†’ + â†’ *Select your lock screen script*  
   Don't forget to make it executable using `chmod +x` and to run it once to provide it with sufficient permissions.
4. If the IP of your VPN client machine is dynamic and you can't reliably resolve its IP, a workaround can be to install [GeekTool](https://www.tynsoe.org/geektool/) and display the output of `ipconfig getifaddr en0` in a script Geeklet. At least you now find out the current IP easily.

#### On your local machine

1. [Create an SSH key](https://www.google.com/search?q=create+ssh+key+macos) or use an existing one
2. Copy the public key of your just created key pair to your Zscaler machine:
   ```shell
   ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa zscaler@Zscaler.local
   ```
   *This snippet assumes that your Zscaler host has the name `Zscaler` and your user account on that machine is `zscaler`.*
3. Check if you can log in:
   ```shell
   ssh zscaler@Zscaler.local printenv
   ```
   If the output shows the environment variables of your Zscaler host, all is fine.

### Execution

The following command needs to be run on your working machine,
which then connects to the host `Zscaler` with user `zscaler`,
and finishes configuring your working machine using the returned configuration Bash script:
```shell
(
  bash <<'SHARE_ZSCALER_V2'
ssh -4t zscaler@Zscaler.local '
bash -c "$(curl -so- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bkahlert/kill-zscaler/main/share-zscaler.v2.sh)" -- \
  --probe foo.bar.internal \
  --domain internal
'
SHARE_ZSCALER_V2
) | bash
```

You get prompted for the password of user `zscaler` (unless you did the optional [sudoers configuration](#on-your-virtual-machine)).

> ðŸ’¡ Users with a VPN host machine with dynamic IP can try to
change the `ssh` command to:
> ```shell
> ssh -4t "zscaler@$(sudo nmap -n -p 22 192.168.206.2-254 -oG - | awk '/Up$/{print $2}')"
> ```
> Be sure to change the `192.168.206` part to match the client's address range.
> The above `nmap` command looks for a machine with an open SSH port and pass the match to the `ssh` command. 

**Example output**:
```

## Troubleshooting
- You can run the setup script as many times as you like.
- The output script to run on your local machine updates your name resolution accordingly,
  that is, it updates existing hosts and adds new ones.
- You will very likely have to update `SHARE_ZSCALER_SOURCE_ADDRESS` to the network used by your Parallels installation.
  - You can look it up by opening System Preferences â†’ Network â†’ Ethernet â†’ IP Address
  - As an example: if the screen shows `192.168.42.3` you'll have to use `SHARE_ZSCALER_SOURCE_ADDRESS=192.168.42.0/24`
- If you happen to have no access anymore
  - check if Zscaler is actually connected
  - run (1) your customized `share-zscaler.sh` call on the VM and (2) its output script on your local machine again.
